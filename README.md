I'm a passionate Computer Science student at CBIT, Hyderabad, with a strong enthusiasm for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics. I enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights and building intelligent systems.

🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to data science and machine learning.

💬 Ask me about Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or anything related to ML!
